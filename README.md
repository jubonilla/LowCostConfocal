# LowCostConfocal
In this repository, we keep some important resources that were applied on the construction of our own design of a low-cost confocal scanning microscope. 

## Detector
The detector is based on an old version of the design presented in the project <a href="https://github.com/OpenSiPM">OpenSiPM</a>, adapted to another Silicon Photomultiplier diode and to a slower scanning system.
